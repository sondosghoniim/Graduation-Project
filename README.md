# Graduation-Project
Liver diseases affect millions of people globally. While Early diagnosis is essential to avoid serious complications, conventional diagnosis methods are often invasive, time consuming, and costly. 
This project suggests using artificial intelligence to detect liver diseases through noninvasive data sources, such as blood tests, medical images, and patient history. The results showed that the AI models were more accurate than traditional methods, which means AI could help make liver disease diagnosis faster and more reliable.
